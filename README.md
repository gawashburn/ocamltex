OCamlTeX is a combination of an OCaml script and LaTeX style file that,
together, give the user the ability to define LaTeX macros in terms of
OCaml code. Once defined, a OCaml macro becomes indistinguishable from
any other LaTeX macro. OCamlTeX thereby combines LaTeX's typesetting
power with OCaml's programmability.
